# Blerg

Super simple cms to serve blog content on my personal site.  Currently using
[Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) with [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet)
to render github-flavored markdown.

### TODO

- Larger formatted code blocks in markdown are currently indented weirdly on the index page
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Inline code blocks should render roughly similarly to markdown on github (particularly
the slightly grey background)
- Add some more monospaced font options for code elements
- Blog manifest via YAML (keep track of posts via published_at and title)
